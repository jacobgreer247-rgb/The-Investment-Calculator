# The-Investment-Calculator
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
C++ investment calculator that lets users enter initial investment, monthly deposit, interest rate, and years to see growth over time. Shows results with and without deposits, highlighting the impact of compound interest while practicing clean, readable code design.
What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job keeping the code organized and easy to read. The formatting of the output table turned out really clear, which makes the results simple to understand. I also commented my code well enough that someone else could follow what each part was doing.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could improve my code by adding better input validation, since right now it doesn’t stop someone from entering negative numbers or letters by mistake. I’d also like to break the program into smaller functions to make it more efficient and easier to update later on.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardest part was getting the compound interest calculations to work correctly with both monthly deposits and yearly compounding. I overcame it by carefully breaking down the formulas step by step and testing each part separately. I also used online C++ references and my class notes to make sure I was applying the math correctly.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project helped me get better at writing clean, organized code and using functions to keep things manageable. I also improved at formatting output and handling user input, which will be useful in pretty much any C++ project or programming assignment in the future.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I kept the code organized with clear function names and consistent indentation. I added comments to explain what each part does, and I separated calculations from input and output so it’s easier to update or change later without breaking other parts of the program.
